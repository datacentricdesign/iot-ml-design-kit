# Welcome to the Machine Learning for Designers application! 
On this page, we will introduce you to the process of using machine learning (ML) in product development.

## Overview
### Getting acquainted with ML
1) Read through this page 
2) Open the Notebook and go through the Use Case

### Preparing your data
3) Collecting your own data
4) Preprocessing

### Inspecting user behavior
5) Labeling and training
6) Investigating output and results

## Some additional information about the steps
_Step 1_: If you've never used Anaconda before or you're not sure if you've opened the right Notebook, consult the [Installation Guide](https://datacentricdesign.github.io/iot-ml-design-kit/guide/installation_guide.html). An overview of some machine learning terms you might not be familiar with can be found in our [Glossary](https://datacentricdesign.github.io/iot-ml-design-kit/other_documents/glossary.html). 

_Step 2_: If this is your first time using the product, we strongly recommend that you follow the demo. Here, you will go through the steps, but with data we collected and prepared for you. This way, you will interactively see what the data, variables and performance are supposed to look like.

_Steps 3-4_: To collect data, you will be using a sensor with a camera yourself. The data collection process consists of a test person using your prototype while the sensor is picking up signals. Looking at the raw sensor data will probably not make any sense, so to actually generate useful data, we will have to extract all information we need to be able to tell activities apart. This is called preprocessing. 

_Steps 5-6_: You will notice that collecting just a few minutes of data generates thousands of data points. To make sure you will have to label as few of those as possible, you will be shown some points and be asked to label those. After that you can just sit back, let our system do its thing and evaluate the results!
